### Task 1

Implement kind of "protection" mechanism, which will prevent user
from providing non-numeric answers. The solution should work in
such way that user should be asked **the same** question as
originally asked, unless correct answer is provided. Then the
algorithm should continue as usual. (Tip: Remember to properly
deal with `NaN` value!).

### Task 2

Besides of informing user on passed (or not) exam, give him / her
feedback on number of correct and incorrect answers.

### Task 3*

How would you modify the code in order to show all correct and
all incorrect results provided.
